# TopoJoy

A command line tool for downloading sections of topo maps and stitching them together. Maps come from [mapbox](http://mapbox.com).

You'll be prompted for a valid api key when you use the app the the first time. You can update your key by typing `topoJoy token`.

You can use [geoJson](https://geojson.io) to produce valid input, though any well formed geoJson features file should work. See the example.
